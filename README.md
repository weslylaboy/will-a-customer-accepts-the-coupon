# Will a customer accepts the coupon? 

This project analyze factors that influence whether a customer accepts a coupon. The project explores the dataset using 
visualizations and basic probability and statistics to distinguish between customers who accepted a coupon versus those who did not.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a coupons dataset. 

The analysis focuses on:
- Cleaning and understanding the data
- Visualizing distributions and relationships
- Comparing groups (accepted vs. not accepted)
- Drawing insights about features that may correlate with coupon acceptance


## Dataset

- Source file: `data/coupons.csv`
- Format: CSV
- Note: The dataset is provided in this repo for convenience. If the dataset is updated or moved, adjust the notebook path accordingly.
